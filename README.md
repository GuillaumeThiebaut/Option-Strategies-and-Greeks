# Option-Strategies-and-Greeks

This website is designed to help users better understand how option strategies work in financial markets. 

First, it allows you to construct various strategies using vanilla options and visualize how their premiums react to different market parameters. Next, the website provides hedge ratios (the “Greeks”) for the strategies, displayed through both 2D and 3D plots, in order to reinforce and deepen the understanding gained in the first page. The key formulas implemented are based on an adjusted Black–Scholes framework (including dividend yield), applied to European vanilla options to ensure clarity and accessibility. 

I hope you find this tool insightful and enjoyable. Stay tuned for further developments!
